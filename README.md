Tree node-finding coding exercise

The program file is find_node.py and can be executed by opening a command line terminal and calling:

python \<file-path\>/find_node.py

The program file leverages the tree and node classes (MyTree and MyNode) defined in module mytree.py.  The code was written in Python 3.6x. 

Tree and node instantiation occur at the top of find_node.py.  The name of the node to be found is passed as a string into the method main().  A classic depth-first search is implemented to find the named node.
